# BD-AvatarHover-Fix

BetterDiscord AvatarHover Plugin (fixed with workaround)

## ⚠️ Abandoned ⚠️
This project is abandoned! No further fixed/updates will follow... ever!  
However, feel free, to develop own fixed based on this. I don't even use BD anymore,
so I can't.

---------------------

I'm not the author, I just fixed some issues occurring since BD 1.3.0!

In case of any legal claims, contact me please.  
No guarantee, that my workaround works for you aswell!

## Installation

1. Open ``C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins``
2. Find ``AvatarHover.plugin.js`` and rename it to ``AvatarHover.plugin.js.bak`` as backup file
3. Download my workaround version and drop it into the plugins folder
4. Toggle the plugin in BetterDiscord and enjoy

## What's AvatarHover about?

Use ``Ctrl`` / ``Ctrl+Shift`` when hovering an avatar to resize it.  
For more information take a look at the [developers page](https://github.com/Inve1951/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/coffee/AvatarHover.plugin.coffee).
