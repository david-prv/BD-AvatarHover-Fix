In case of any legal claims, contact me please.  
No guarantee, that my workaround works for you aswell!

## Installation

Open ``C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins`` and find ``AvatarHover.plugin.js``. Rename it to ``AvatarHover.plugin.js.bak`` as backup file. Then download my workaround version and drop it into the plugins folder. Toggle the plugin in BetterDiscord and enjoy.
